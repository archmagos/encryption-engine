## Simple Encryption Engine

A simple encryption (and decryption) engine built in Elm.

```
Take every second character from the string, then the other characters that are not every second character, and concat them as a new String.
Can do this n times

If input-string is null or empty, return this value
If n <= 0, return input text
```
